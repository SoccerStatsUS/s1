Time to migrate to postgresql. SQLite doesn't support unique constraints.
Also, this will allow geoDjango support!

Some of the main problems with this site:

1. Need a stronger scraping infrastructure.
2. Need better testing.
3. Need much better facilities for managing duplicate (players/leagues/teams/games)

5. Maybe an alias model that maps a name to a generic foreign key? Unique on the name/gfk combination.
