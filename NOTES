Time to migrate to postgresql. SQLite doesn't support unique constraints.
Also, this will allow geoDjango support!

Some of the main problems with this site:

1. Need a stronger scraping infrastructure.
2. Need better testing.
3. Need much better facilities for managing duplicate (players/leagues/teams/games)

5. Maybe an alias model that maps a name to a generic foreign key? Unique on the name/gfk combination.


So the unifying idea behind how to keep stats on the site:

Every game is part of several competitions. We save stats for each competition into a stats object. That should be relatively standard. 

So a regular season MLS 2011 game would be part of:
MLS regular season 2011, regularseasoncareer, everythingcareer

A mls playoff game would be part of:
MLS playofss 2011, playoffscareer, everythingcareer

A friendly would be part of:
friendly, (that's it)

# This would solve the long-lasting MLS open cup / regular season problem.


# A competition is simply a name.
# It could have some other information, like country, or format (round-robin, league)
# A start and end. (could be figured programatically)
